ShareProgress Bookmarklet Generator


jQueryScriptLoader.js will load external scripts like jQuery and your own JavaScripts on a web page. This will allow you to create code that is longer than 2000 characters. Add the jQueryScriptLoader.js code to the ShareProgress Bookmarklet Generator: http://www.shareprogress.org/bookmarklet/ to generate your bookmarklet link.


Our TableThis.js bookmarklet is an example of a bookmarklet that will help you with downloading the raw data from a table you find on a webpage and save it as a CSV file. 

When your cursor hovers over a table it notifies the user to click on the table to download it. 

The TableThis bookmarklet will handle UTF-16 characters, images, inner tables, commas, varying number of columns in each row, etc. So that your data will come out properly. Let us know if there are cases when it isn't. 

Visit our test HTML Table http://www.shareprogress.org/bookmarklet/htmltabletest/ to try it out.

Fork this repo and show us what kinds of bookmarklets you create.
