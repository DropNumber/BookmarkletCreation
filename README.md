**ShareProgress Bookmarklet Generator**


jQueryScriptLoader.js will load external scripts like jQuery and your own JavaScripts on a web page. This will allow you to create code that is longer than 2000 characters. To add your own external script file, just edit the scriptURL variable to your file's location. 

Note: If you want users to use your bookmarklet while on secure sites (ones that start with https://), youâ€™ll need to host your script on a server with an SSL-certificate.

Copy & paste the jQueryScriptLoader.js code to the ShareProgress Bookmarklet Generator: http://www.shareprogress.org/bookmarklet/ to generate your bookmarklet link.

**Example Bookmarklet: TableThis**

Our TableThis.js bookmarklet is an example of a bookmarklet that will help you with downloading the raw data from a table you find on a webpage and save it as a CSV file. 

When your cursor hovers over a table it notifies the user to click on the table to download it. 

The TableThis bookmarklet will handle UTF-16 characters, images, inner tables, commas, varying number of columns in each row, etc. So that your data will come out properly. Let us know if there are cases when it isn't. 

Visit our test HTML Table http://www.shareprogress.org/bookmarklet/htmltabletest/ to try it out.

Fork this repo and show us what kinds of bookmarklets you create.
